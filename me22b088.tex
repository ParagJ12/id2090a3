\begin{equation}
	[x=16\sin^3(t), y=13\cos(t)-5\cos(2t)-2\cos(3t)-\cos(4t), 0\leq t\leq2\pi]\footnote{MIT shared this on Feb 14, 2021 on their Facebook page. Visit link "https://www.facebook.com/MITnews/videos/valentines-day-2021/335257414441333" for more info.}
	\label{eqn:Polfav}
\end{equation}

Eqn~\ref{eqn:Polfav} shows a parametric equation, the graph of which is a heart shaped curve.

The area of this heart is 180$\pi$.\footnote{The area value has been quoted from the following webpage: "https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html"}
